# About

This app was made using streamlit for the codenation Aceleradev Challenge 2020

## How does it work

A Tf-Idf matrix was created using the dataset features

With this matrix, the cosine similarity is calculated between the
given ids and the dataset.

Then, a score is attributed to each example on the dataset by
the mean of the similarity scores

This is a static demo, meaning that no computations are made.

You can find the complete version of the app on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/flycher/codenation-aceleradev-ds-2020)
